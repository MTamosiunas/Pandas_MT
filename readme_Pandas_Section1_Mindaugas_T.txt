Step 3. Assign it to a variable called users and use the 'user_id' as index
in lines #9 and #10
 
Step 4. See the first 25 entries
in line #12
 
Step 5. See the last 10 entries
in line #13
 
Step 6. What is the number of observations in the dataset?
in line #15: 
simply, the result for printing the whole dataframe is [943 rows x 4 columns]
initially, while inspecting the data, the rows indicate the number of observations;
so, there are 943 observations in the dataset (as each row indicates a single observation, starting from #1)   
 
Step 7. What is the number of columns in the dataset?
4 columns (line#15)

Step 8. Print the name of all the columns.
in line #18
 
Step 9. How is the dataset indexed?
in line #21
Integer based indexing (Int64Index: 943 entries, 1 to 943)
 
Step 10. What is the data type of each column?
in line #21
Data type = Object for 'gender', 'occupation', 'zip_code' columns;
Data type = integer for 'age' column
 
Step 11. Print only the occupation column
in line #24
 
Step 12. How many different occupations are in this dataset?
in line #26 (21 positions)
 
Step 13. What is the most frequent occupation?
in line #28 (student)
 
Step 14. Summarize the DataFrame.
in line #30 

Step 15. Summarize all the columns
in lines # 33, 35, 37, 39

Step 16. Summarize only the occupation column
in line #37 

Step 17. What is the mean age of users?
in line #42 (34.05196182396607)

Step 18. What is the age with least occurrence?
