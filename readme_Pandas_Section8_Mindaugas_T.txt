Step 1. Import the necessary libraries
lines#3-5
 
Step 2. Create a data dictionary that looks like the DataFrame below
lines #7-12 

Step 3. Assign it to a variable called pokemon
 
evolution	hp	name	pokedex	type
0	Ivysaur	45	Bulbasaur	yes	grass
1	Charmeleon	39	Charmander	no	fire
2	Wartortle	44	Squirtle	yes	water
3	Metapod	45	Caterpie	no	bug

Some explanation is needed here. Do I need to convert a dictionary to a DataFrame? As indicated in Step 4, the DataFrame should be present already.
If so, then the Step 3 is in lines #15-17.

Step 4. Ops...it seems the DataFrame columns are in alphabetical order. Place the order of the columns as name, type, hp, evolution, pokedex
lines #19-24
 
Step 5. Add another column called place, and insert what you have in mind.
line #26
 
Step 6. Present the type of each column
lines #29-31
